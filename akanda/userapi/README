You also have to update Quantum's policy file for the extension to work with
authZ.

    "create_portforward": [],
    "get_portforward": [["rule:admin_or_owner"]],
    "update_portforward": [["rule:admin_or_owner"]],
    "delete_portforward": [["rule:admin_or_owner"]]


If you want to use quotas:

add to the QUOTAS section of quantum.conf

quota_portforward = 10
