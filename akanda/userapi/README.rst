User-facing API
===============

This is the home for the REST API that users will be calling directly with
their preferred REST tool (curl, Python wrapper, etc.).

This code will eventually become part of OpenStack or act as a source or
inspiration that will. As such, this API should be constructed entirely with
standard OpenStack tools.
