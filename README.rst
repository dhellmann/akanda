An open source packet filter solution for OpenStack deployments.


About
=====


The Code
--------
The code for this project contains the following:

* a simple, blocking API that wraps py-pf

* various scripts that make use of this API

* a non-blocking REST server that also makes use of this API


The Product
-----------

Basically, any OS with the following installed and running on it, we consider
an Akanda product:

* PF

* py-pf

* the Akanda REST server


The Name
--------

We originally wanted to go with the name अनर्थक (anarthaka, "bullshit"). But
sadly, this term also conveys things like "worthless," "useless," and
"unprofitable." As a product (even an open source one), these are not very
positive associations ;-)

However, we found we were able to say something more clearly and with a bevy of
excellent synonyms by using the Sanskrit word अखण्ड (akhaNDa) which has such
lovely connotations as "non-stop," "undivided," "entire," "whole," and most
importantly, "not broken."
